# IoT-Based-Predictive-Analytics-for-Crop-Yield

Agriculture plays a vital role in feeding the worldâ€™s expanding population and is the primary 
livelihood for a large portion of the population in India. Improving food production to meet the 
growing demand is essential. Farmers need to adopt modern practices to maximize output and 
minimize losses. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool in forecasting and analysing 
crop growth, significantly enhancing precision in the agricultural sector. Smart farming 
integrates various technologies, such as IoT sensors, data analytics, and precision agriculture 
techniques, to boost productivity and optimize resource usage. The primary aim of smart 
agricultural systems is to improve field productivity, minimize resource consumption, and 
enhance overall crop yield. Our project was initiated to explore the potential of machine 
learning and IoT in predicting crop yields accurately, helping farmers make informed decisions 
and improve their agricultural practices .
